        	<h3>Why Hash Brown Patties?</h3>
			<p>Growing up as a child of an immigrant, having a quick meal has always been something my whole family is familiar with. When it comes to breakfast, popping a freezer hash brown patty in a toaster was one of the ways my mom would serve breakfast. It was simple, satisfying, and perfect for busy mornings. But as I got older, I started experimenting with different ways to make hash browns more exciting and, honestly, a little tastier and fresher. That's where homemade hashbrown patties came in—a way to keep that nostalgic breakfast favorite but add a new twist to it.</p>
            <p>Here are two of my favourite easy recipes that utilizes hash brown patties: one classic and another with a cheesy, garlicky flavor that feels like a treat. They’re easy to make and perfect for anyone looking to upgrade their breakfast routine.</p>

            <h3>The Classic</h3>
        	<div class="image-container">
        		<img src="img/recipe-classic-potato-patties.webp" alt="A top shot of potato pancakes on a plate." title="Simple Potato Patties.">
        	</div>
			<p>This recipe brings back so many memories of quick, no-fuss breakfasts from my childhood. There’s something so comforting about biting into a simple, golden-brown hashbrown with a perfect balance of crispy and fluffy. It reminds me of the easy mornings when my mom would make a fast, satisfying breakfast. Now, with this homemade version, I get to recreate that cozy feeling but with my own twist!</p>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 medium potatoes (Russet or Yukon Gold are the best)</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt(to taste)</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp black pepper(to taste)</li>
                <li>1 tsp neutral oil or butter for frying.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the Potatoes:</strong> Peel and grate the potatoes using a box grater. Place the grated potatoes in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. The drier the potatoes, the crispier the patties!</li>
                    <li><strong>Season and Shape:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, add the shredded potatoes, salt, and pepper. Mix well, then form small handfuls into compact patties (about 3 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the oil or butter. Once heated, carefully place the patties in the skillet. Let them cook undisturbed for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown and crispy. Avoid pressing down on the patties as they cook to keep them fluffy inside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the pan and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately with eggs, bacon, or your favorite breakfast items.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Cheesy & Garlic</h3>
        	<div class="image-container">
        		<img src="img/recipe-hashbrowns.webp" alt="Hashbrown plates with some vegetables and sour cream." title="Well-Plated Patties.">
        	</div>
            <p>This version is like the “grown-up” hashbrown patty—a little more fun and full of flavor with the cheesy, garlicky twist! It’s the kind of breakfast that feels like a treat, especially with a sprinkle of green onion for extra flavor. Making these feels like adding a little upgrade to my favorite childhood breakfast, and they’re always a hit whenever I make them for friends or family.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and grated (Like the ones in The Classic)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, minced (or 1/4 tsp garlic powder)</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp neutral oil or butter for frying.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the Potatoes:</strong> Grate the potatoes, then squeeze out any excess water by wrapping them in a kitchen towel or paper towels. This step ensures the patties are crispy rather than soggy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mix Ingredients:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded potatoes, cheddar cheese, garlic (or garlic powder), salt, pepper, and green onion if using. Mix until the ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Form Patties:</strong> Scoop a handful of the mixture and press it together firmly to form a patty about 3 inches wide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook the Patties:</strong> Heat the oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the patties, cooking each side for about 4-5 minutes until the outsides are crispy and the cheese is melted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong>Place the patties on a plate lined with paper towels to drain, then serve hot with sour cream, salsa, or any favorite dip! In my case, I added a few vegetables with a sour cream dip on the side.</li>
                </ol>
